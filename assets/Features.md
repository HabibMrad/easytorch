### Features of easytorch.
* Minimal configuration to setup a new experiment.
* Use your choice of Neural Network architecture.
* Automatic k-fold cross validation.
* Automatic logging/plotting, and model checkpointing.
* Works on all sort of neural network related task.
* GPU enabled metrics like precision, recall, f1, overlap, and confusion matrix with maximum GPU utilization.
* Ability to automatically combine/pool multiple datasets without having to move the data from original location.
* Reconstruction of the predicted image is very easy even if we train on patches of images like U-Net. Please check the example below.
* Limit data loading for easy debugging
* Save everything: the logs, seeds, models, plots...etc. Thus, easy to replicate experiments.
* Multiple metrics Precision, Recall, Accuracy, Overlap, F1, ROC-AUC, Confusion matrix
* **...will keep on addding. Stay tuned!**
